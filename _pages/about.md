I am a final-year PhD candidate in Computer Science & Engineering at IIIT-Delhi, India, with a focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Social Sciences (CSS). My current research, under the guidance of [Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://tanmoychak.com/) and [Dr. Md Shad Akhtar](https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~shad.akhtar/), examines the "Genesis and Spread of Online Claims in the Context of Misinformation." I am passionate about developing AI-driven solutions that address real-world challenges, particularly those that support fact-checking and enhance the integrity of information on social media.

I had the opportunity to work as a Visiting Researcher at the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, UAE, where I collaborated with [Prof. Preslav Nakov](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/preslav-nakov/) on projects aimed at claim normalization and simplification in social media posts. My earlier academic journey includes a Master’s in Computer Science from the University of Delhi, where I explored fake profile detection on online platforms.


I am currently seeking PostDoc positions with broad interests in the factuality and biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), computational social sciences, and responsible AI. Thank you for visiting my website! I'm open to new opportunities and collaborations—let’s shape the future of machine learning together. Feel free to reach out to discuss potential projects or partnerships.
