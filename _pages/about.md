Hello! My name is Megha (she/her). I a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP)](https://www.mpi-sp.org/) in Data Science for Humanity Group, advised by [Meeyoung Cha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha_Meeyoung).My research lies at the intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Social Science (CSS), with a focus on misinformation, online narratives, and information integrity.

Before joining MPI-SP, I completed my PhD in Computer Science & Engineering at IIIT-Delhi, India. My doctoral research, supervised by [Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty](https://tanmoychak.com/) and [Dr. Md Shad Akhtar](https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~shad.akhtar/), examined the “Genesis and spread of online claims in the context of misinformation.” I am passionate about developing AI-driven methods that support fact-checking and improve the situation of digital information ecosystems.

I had the opportunity to work as a Visiting Researcher at the [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), where I collaborated with [Prof. Preslav Nakov](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/preslav-nakov/) on projects aimed at claim normalization and simplification in social media posts. My earlier academic journey includes a Master’s in Computer Science from the University of Delhi, where I explored fake profile detection on online platforms.


Thank you for visiting my website! I am always interested in meaningful collaborations in the areas of factuality and biases in Large Language Models (LLMs), computational social science, and responsible AI. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss research ideas, or potential collaborations.
